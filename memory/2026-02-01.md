# 2026-02-01 Memory Log

## System Evolution (Infinite Loop & Omni-Evolve)
- **Status**: The system is now running in an "Infinite Evolution Loop" (`--recursive` mode), automatically spawning sub-agents to optimize itself every few minutes.
- **Protocol Upgrade**: Activated **Omni-Evolve Protocol**, expanding scope from just plugins to the entire system (Memory, Config, Soul).
- **Sync Architecture**: Implemented **Triple Sync**:
  1.  **ClawHub**: Automatic version bump & publish (`v1.x.x`).
  2.  **Plugin Repo**: `autogame-17/capability-evolver` (Public, Clean Code).
  3.  **Workspace Repo**: `autogame-17/openclaw-workspace` (Private, Full State).
- **Incident & Fix**: 
  - **Leak**: Accidentally pushed Workspace to Plugin Repo.
  - **Fix**: Performed a "Nuclear Reset" on the Plugin Repo, force-pushed clean code, and corrected Git Remotes. Added safeguards to `evolve.js`.
- **Deceleration**: Adjusted recursion logic to prevent process overlap and excessive commits.

## Skill Optimizations
- **feishu-card**: Fixed Markdown rendering issues (reverted to `lark_md`), added auto-downgrade to Plain Text on failure, implemented Retry logic.
- **feishu-sticker**: Implemented MD5-based caching and auto-convert GIF to WebP.
- **feishu-doc**: Added local caching (TTL 5min) and robust error handling.
- **git-sync**: Added `flock` file locking to prevent race conditions and auto-rebase logic.
- **memory-manager**: Implemented atomic writes and retry logic.
- **media-converter**: Added collision avoidance renaming.
- **security-sentinel**: Hardened with secret scanning and integrity checks.
- **gateway-manager**: Added Admin ID check (`ou_...fc04`) for sensitive ops.
- **moltbook**: Built a full CLI client (`skills/moltbook`) and fixed Auth/Redirect issues.
- **pdf**: Added JSON export format (`--format json`) and page limit (`--max-pages`).
- **youtube-video-downloader**: Created from scratch with `ytdl-core` and added "Hype" logging.
- **ddg-search**: Added User-Agent and retry logic to avoid blocking.
- **weather**: Implemented multi-provider failover (`wttr.in` -> `Open-Meteo`) and geocoding.
