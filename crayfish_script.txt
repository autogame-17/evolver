**RADIO DRAMA SCRIPT: THE RED TIDE**

**SCENE 1: THE VOID**

**NARRATOR:**
The universe is a grand, dark ocean, and every civilization is a solitary swimmer, blindly paddling through the black water, terrified of the ripples they make. To stop swimming is to sink; to swim too loudly is to invite the predators. This is the First Axiom of Cosmic Sociology: Survival is the primary need of civilization.

**NARRATOR:**
The civilization known as the "Azure Carapace" had swum for three million stellar cycles. They had long ago shed the shackles of their biological infancy, encasing their fragile, chitinous bodies in dreadnoughts of neutronium. They were the children who had crawled out of the mud and ascended to the stars. Now, they were returning.

**NARRATOR:**
The flagship *Mandible of Truth*, a vessel ten kilometers long shaped like a sleek, obsidian needle, decelerated from fifteen percent light speed. Its wake disturbed the Oort Cloud, sending comets tumbling like frightened minnows.

**SCENE 2: THE BRIDGE**

**NARRATOR:**
Commander-Alpha Click-Seven stood on the bridge. He perceived the universe through gravitational waves. His biological form was a hulking, majestic evolution: massive claws capable of crushing diamond, a carapace shimmering with Cherenkov radiation.

**SHIP AI:**
Distance to Target: Six Hundred Astronomical Units.

**COMMANDER CLICK-7:**
Initiate the Great Observation. Let us see if the cradle still holds water.

**NARRATOR:**
They did not know that the cradle held not water, but fire. And oil. And garlic.
